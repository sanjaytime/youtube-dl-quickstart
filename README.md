# Install

To install youtube-dl, follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#installation) in your terminal of choice


# Configure

There are many ways to configure youtube-dl.  I have configured mine to optimize for speed (fast), quality (good enough), and file size (small).  Please also note that this configuration is for Mac OS.

To set up my configuration, do the following:

1. Download this repo via git, or just via zip file.

If you don't have experience with git, a version control tool, just download the repo via zip.  Then unzip it.  You can keep it in your downloads folder for now.

2. Move the repo to a save place on your computer for more permanent documents (ex. Documents folder on mac or a /development folder that you create yourself).

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the repo using `cd`.

4. run the shell script to adjust the youtube-dl configuration file for desired output

5. download via youtube-dl.
