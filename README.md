To set up my configuration, do the following:

1. Download this repo via git, or just via zip file.

If you don't have experience with git, a version control tool, just download the repo via zip.  Then unzip it.  You can keep it in your downloads folder for now.

2. Get your desired output folder
3. find your asdfadsf

4. run the script to adjust the script for desired output



5. Open your terminal and navigate to this repo

If you downloaded via zip, make sure that you unzip the file, and then simply open your terminal and run the following:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/youtube-dl-master
```

If you downloded via git, just navigate to the root of this repository.
